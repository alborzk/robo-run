Tested on a Windows 10 NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti device

## ❔ About
- This is a simple "runner" type game that resets upon completion
- You play as a very determined robot
- The goal is to reach the magical rubber ducky
- There are multiple different obstacles with different functionalities
- The wood tree stumps collide with the user and block movement unless they are jumped over. It has 2 textures applied.
- The frog is an interesting geometry that moves and hops like a frog does. When they are collided with, they animate
  into a "dead frog" and provide the user with an extra jump.
- The water is hazardous, and sends the user back to the start upon collision. It must be jumped over. It is textured.
- The rubber ducky is the goal point, sending the user back to the start, but in a good way (marking completion).

## 🕹️ Controls
- SPACE: Jump
- ENTER: Change Camera Mode (First/Third Person)
- LCLICK (HOLD): Freelook (First Person)
- Q: Change Scenery (Day/Night)

There are also extra systems - Environmental Skyboxing/Particle Systems, and Shading/Lighting. This exists in the form of a "Night" scenery. 
It begins snowing, the textures of the ground and skybox change, and there are lighting effects including a directional light (more noticeable with freelook)
